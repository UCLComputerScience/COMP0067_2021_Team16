## Newborn Baby App

**What does this application do and why?**

Our app features Dr Iya Whiteleyâ€™s research-informed black and white development images from Cosmic Baby Books. The app displays slideshows (with accompanying audio narration) to newborn babies in order to:

* Aid with the physiological development of their eyes and brain
* Calm them quickly
* Entertain and engage them
* Enable parents to take a break

In the browser, the client is able to upload new images, audios, music and slideshows for users to view on the mobile app. 

On the mobile app, users can: 

* Sign up through an email form to hear updates about Cosmic Baby Books
* Adjust the audio and visual settings, based on the age of their baby
* Read about Dr Iya Whiteley and the science behind her work

**How the application is organised**

Newborn Baby App is divided into the following folders:

* backend - contains the code for the client website hosted on Azure
* public - contains the code for components and pages displayed on the mobile app
* src - contains the Ionic code which supports the mobile app
* build - contains the production code for the mobile app
* ios - contains the code for the mobile app for iOS devices (i.e., iPhone, iPad)
* android - contains the code for the mobile app for Android devices (i.e., Galaxy S5, Surface Duo) 
* gitignore - instructs GitHub to omit any extraneous files, such as node modules
