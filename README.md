## Newborn Baby App

**What does this application do and why?**

Our app features Dr Iya Whiteleyâ€™s research-informed black and white development images from Cosmic Baby Books. The app displays slideshows to newborn babies in order to:

* Aid with the physiological development of their eyes and brain
* Calm them quickly
* Entertain and engage them
* Enable parents to take a break

In the browser, the client is able to upload new images, audios, music and slideshows for users to view on the mobile app. 

On the mobile app, users can: 

* Sign up through an email form to hear updates about Cosmic Baby Books.
* Adjust the audio and visual settings, based on the age of their baby.
* Read about Dr Iya Whiteley and the science behind her work.
